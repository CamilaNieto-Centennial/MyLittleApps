# My Little Apps
Welcome to My Little Apps, a repository containing small apps written in JavaScript. The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my growth as a developer and professional. It's worth mentioning that while some of the README files may have been sourced from other repositories, the actual implementation of the apps—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—has been authored by me.

## Attribution
I want to give credit to the original sources that provided me with inspiration and ideas for certain README files. Whenever a README file has been adapted or directly taken from another repository, I have included the appropriate references at the end of that file. It's important to acknowledge the valuable contributions and insights from these sources.

Please note that even though I have used existing README files as references, the apps themselves are my own creations and represent my skills and abilities as a developer.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find value in exploring the apps within it.
